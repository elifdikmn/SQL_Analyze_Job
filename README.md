# Background
The idea for this project was born from a simple question ‚Äî *what does it really take to land one of the top-paid data analyst jobs today?*

I wanted to go beyond job titles and buzzwords to see which **skills**, **tools**, and **roles** truly stand out in the market. The goal: help myself and others navigate the data job landscape more strategically.

The dataset comes from [Luke Barousse‚Äôs SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql) ‚Äî a rich collection of job postings packed with details about salaries, companies, locations, and required skills.

### The questions I set out to answer:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?  
2. What skills do these top-paying jobs require?  
3. Which skills are most in demand overall?  
4. Which skills lead to higher salaries?  
5. And ultimately ‚Äî what are the most *valuable* skills to learn?

# Tools I Used
To dive deep into this analysis, I leaned on a toolkit built for real data exploration:

- **SQL** ‚Äì The heart of the project, used to slice, join, and analyze job posting data.  
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì A robust database engine to manage complex queries efficiently.  
- **Visual Studio Code** ‚Äì My command center for running SQL and managing data files.  
- **Git & GitHub** ‚Äì For version control, collaboration, and publishing my SQL scripts and visualizations.

# The Analysis
Each SQL query was designed to uncover a piece of the story behind data analyst careers ‚Äî from salaries and demand to skill optimization.

### 1. Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To spotlight the most lucrative positions, I filtered for **Data Analyst** roles that were remote and had reported salaries.

```sql
SELECT	
	job_id,
	job_title,
	job_location,
	job_schedule_type,
	salary_year_avg,
	job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;

** Titles varied ‚Äî from Data Analyst to Director of Analytics ‚Äî revealing how diverse the analytics career ladder can be.



### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs

To find what sets these top jobs apart, I connected the high-salary roles with their listed skills.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT	
        job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC;
```

Insights:
**SQL** was the most requested skill, appearing in 8 of the top 10 postings.
**Python** followed closely (7 mentions), with Tableau not far behind (6 mentions).
Other valuable tools ‚Äî **R, Snowflake, Pandas, and Excel** ‚Äî also made the list, rounding out the data toolkit that employers prize.




### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts

This query focused on which skills show up most frequently across all remote job postings ‚Äî not just the top-paying ones.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' 
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 5;


```

What the data revealed:
**SQL** and **Excel** dominate ‚Äî still the bedrock skills for analysis and reporting.
**Python, Tableau, and Power BI** are essential for technical storytelling and advanced analytics.

| Skills   | Demand Count |
|----------|--------------|

### 4.Skills Associated with Higher Salaries

Here I looked at which skills correlate with higher average salaries among data analyst roles.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills,
    ROUND(AVG(salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

Insights from the data:
- **Big Data & ML tools like PySpark, DataRobot, and Jupyter command the highest pay.
- **Development & pipeline tools such as GitLab, Airflow, and Kubernetes bridge analytics and engineering ‚Äî a lucrative combo.
- **Cloud technologies like Databricks and GCP push salaries higher, reflecting a growing shift toward cloud analytics.

### 5. The Most Optimal Skills to Learn
Finally, I combined both salary and demand data to find the sweet spot ‚Äî skills that are both valuable and sought after
```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    AND job_work_from_home = True 
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) > 10
ORDER BY
    avg_salary DESC,
    demand_count DESC
LIMIT 25;
```

| Skill ID | Skills     | Demand Count | Average Salary ($) |
|----------|------------|--------------|-------------------:|
